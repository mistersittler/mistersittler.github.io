I have been a designer and art director for many years, working on a variety of projects including websites, brand-related print and lots of magazine design. While still enjoying aspects of that work, I began longing for something that offered more of the analytical, problem-solving parts and less of the subjective parts. I became obsessed with user-experience design and learned what I could through the Interaction Design Foundation, but found it difficult to break into a UX role. Over the years, I also kept returning to building websites, but never took the deep dive into the programming languages. It seemed like the time was right to skill-up, and so here I am.

My Goals
I plan to graduate from this program with a solid foundation for web development, and I hope to gain an understanding of whether I like the full stack or the frontend better. I also hope to begin an interesting career combining web development with a user-centered focus.

Onward!
